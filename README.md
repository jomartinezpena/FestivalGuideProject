# Project 3: Festival Guide 

### November 20, 2024
By: Johnathan Martinez Pena


## Project Overview:

For this project, I chose to focus my festival on light pollution, and how it will raise awareness to such problem. The organization my festival will support is the Interanation Dark-Sky Association, an organization that works to reduce light emmissions. 

Raising awareness about light pollution is crucial for protecting wildlife and human health. Artificial lighting interferes with the natural behaviors of animals, such as turtles and birds, whose hatchlings and migrations habits are particularly sensitve to these disruptions. It also affects human health by causing insomnia, melatonin suppresin, and potentially increasing the risk of cancer. 

Minimizing light pollution helps strengthen our bond with nature, allowing people to appreaciate the beauty of the nigth sky, which is becoming increasingly rare in cities. By advocating for responsible lighting practices, we can work to restore the natural cycles that all living beings depend on and ensure that future generations can enjoy the stars.

## Technical Overview:

- Incorporation of dark sky theme, with stars and elements that would relate to the topic on light pollution. 
- Skyscrapers, artificial lights, and the night sky in the background of the website to represent the problem, and to put a greater emphasis on the cause that is being addressed in this website. 
- Animated text that would lead to other pages upon hover. 
- Merchandise that would be disposable, and would promote the event/festival.

The coding languages I'm utilizing include: 
- HTML: To structure the website, by including text, and a navigation to the different pages included in the project. 
- CSS: To style the website, including color in text and in background, fonts, layout of the website, transformations, and effects. 

I am using GitHub as the platform for hosting and managing my code. And all included images, and illustrations are edited from Adobe Photoshop or done by Adobe Illustrator.
