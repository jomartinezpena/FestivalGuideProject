         <h2>Dec 8th(11 am - 1pm): Light Art Instillation</h2>
            
         <p>
            Start the event with an art installation to simulate the effects of light pollution. Where
            a dimmed or softly lit area symbolizes a sky covered by artificial lights, and at 
            the designated start time, the lights fade, and a revealing projection of a star-filled 
            sky and the stars as "LED's" to help simulate the beauty of an unpolluted sky. Emphasizing the 
            festival's cause of light pollution.
